## What is this :grey_question: 

The rules of the game are explained [in my original](https://maebli.github.io/rust/2021/10/18/100rust.html). 

## 80th Challenge
### Challenge

Write hello world on a waveshare-rp2040-lcd-0.96.

### Solution :white_check_mark:

It was a bit tough getting some good information on the board. I could not find a good pinout, datasheet or working code at first. 
However after some digging I found [https://github.com/rp-rs/rp-hal-boards](https://github.com/rp-rs/rp-hal-boards) which has an example.

The example works out of the box, but its not easily extracted, stand alone project. So I created the project template [https://github.com/maebli/waveshare-rp2040-lcd-0-9-6-template](https://github.com/maebli/waveshare-rp2040-lcd-0-9-6-template).

Starting from this template we can flash the board with

``` shell
cargo install cargo-generate
cargo generate maebli/waveshare-rp2040-lcd-0-9-6-template --name my-project
cd waveshare-rp2040-lcd-0-9-6-template
```

The raspberry pi pico is hooked up to a pico debugger over SWO 3 wire interface. Its powered via USB-C.

And there we have it
