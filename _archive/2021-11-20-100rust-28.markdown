## What is this :grey_question: 

The rules of the game are explained [in my original post](https://maebli.github.io/rust/2021/10/18/100rust.html). 

## 28th Challenge
### Challenge :bug::hammer: 

Today's challenge is a bit different; Rather than programming I will be getting my tool-set into order. I want to debug. This means today's
challenge is to setup debugging for Rust. Up until now I did not Debug at all. Debugging is a powerful method to understand code and be efficient. 

### Solution :white_check_mark:

As I am using Intellij I will set this up for said tool-chain. Sadly, this is only available in the paid version. I was not inclined
to change to VS Code, being one of the two most popular tool-chains besides Intellij/ C-Lion by Jetbrain. I therefore purchased the license
on a monthly plan and installed the [Native Debugging Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12775-native-debugging-support) and I was
good to go. And it works! Very simple and powerful setup:
