## What is this :grey_question: 

The rules of the game are explained [in my original](https://maebli.github.io/rust/2021/10/18/100rust.html). 
I haven't posted in a while but I want to get started again. 

## 51st Challenge
### Challenge

Today the challenge is to parse and extract information from a yaml. And not just any yaml, all the yamls in the repos
[things network lorawan devices](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-devices). Bonus: make some statistics from the files. Lets get started.

### Solution :white_check_mark:


This was failry simple but fun. The hard work was done by the [yaml rust](https://lib.rs/crates/yaml-rust).


	{% highlight rust %}
    extern crate yaml_rust;
    use yaml_rust::{YamlLoader, YamlEmitter};

    fn main() {
        let vendor_yaml_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-devices/master/vendor/index.yaml";
        let vendor_yaml = reqwest::blocking::get(vendor_yaml_url).unwrap().text().unwrap();

        let vendors = YamlLoader::load_from_str(&vendor_yaml).unwrap();
        let vendors = vendors[0]["vendors"].clone();

        /* minus 1 because there is a "example" vendor */
        let vendor_count = vendors.as_vec().unwrap().len()-1;

        println!("There are currently {} vendors in the Things Network device repository. ", vendor_count);

    }

	{% endhighlight %}
