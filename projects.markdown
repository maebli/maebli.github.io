Here is a none-exhaustive list of projects I have worked on:

- **Tweety** - closed source, proof of concept for a **LoRaWAN** based bird tracking device, tested in collaboration with a ornithological institute
- [Rust Luzern Meetup](https://rust-luzern.ch/) - A meetup for Rust enthusiasts in Luzern
