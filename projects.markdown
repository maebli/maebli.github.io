Here is a none-exhaustive list of projects I have worked on:

- [m-bus-parser (wired)](https://github.com/maebli/m-bus-parser) - An open source parser for the M-Bus protocol in **Rust**
- **Tweety** - closed source, proof of concept for a **LoRaWAN** based bird tracking device, tested in collaboration with a ornithological institute
