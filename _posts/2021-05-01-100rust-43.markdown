## What is this :grey_question: 

The rules of the game are explained [in my original post](https://maebli.github.io/rust/2021/10/18/100rust.html). 

## 43rd Challenge
### Challenge

Today I'm posting the first time this year. I had to take an unplanned break in the middle of AOC 2021. I plan to finish AOC 2021 and clean up my answers that are unfinished, but first I want to do some other things on other topics. Today's challeng is to explore the concept of `lifetimes` by example. 

Today I want to answer the question, what is the difference between `const X:&str = "0"` and `let x: &'static str = "0"` ? 


### Solution :white_check_mark:

The difference between constant `const` and a variable is written in the [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.const.html) for the `const` key word 

> constants are inlined wherever they’re used, making using them identical to simply replacing the name of the const with its value

oh the other hand ..

> Static variables, on the other hand, point to a single location in memory, which all accesses share.


To me it seems this would be useful when implementing a singleton pattern in rust. So I did just that bellow.

	{% highlight rust %}
	   {

	// Boilerplate for my singelton example
	struct A;
	static THING:A = A{};
	fn getInstance() -> &'static A {
	    &THING
	}

	fn main() {

	    {
	        // The following two lines are identical
	        // due to static lifetime elision both
	        // variables have a 'static lifetime
	        const X1: &str = "a";
	        const X2: &'static str = "a";

	        // The following will add three string literals
	        // to the memory of the binary
	        let _a = X1;
	        let _b = X1;
	        let _c = X1;

	        // When  these constants go out of scope, their references
	        // can no longer be used, but the data remains in the binary.
	    }

	    {
	        // Two ways to make a constant with `'static` lifetime.
	        let X1: &'static str = "a";
	        static X2: &str = "a";

	        // The following will add three references
	        // non mutable borrows to X1 and NOT three
	        // three new string literals to the binary
	        let _a = X1;
	        let _b = X1;
	        let _c = X1;
	        // When  these constants go out of scope, their references
	        // can no longer be used, but the data remains in the binary.
	    }


	    {
	        // Implementing the singleton pattern
	        let _a = getInstance();
	        let _b = getInstance();
	    }

	}
	{% endhighlight %}
