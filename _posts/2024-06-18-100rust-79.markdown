## What is this :grey_question: 

The rules of the game are explained [in my original](https://maebli.github.io/rust/2021/10/18/100rust.html). 

## 79th Challenge
### Challenge

Prepare for the [rust workshop](https://rustfest.ch/workshops/rust-on-microcontrollers/) hosted by [rustfest.ch](rustfest.ch) and summarize what was learnt. 

### Solution :white_check_mark:

To get things flashed and get debugging with probe.rs. I am going to try different things starting with the probe. 

But first I install all the required dependencies. 

    {% highlight bash %}
    # install compilation targets
    rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi
    rustup target add --toolchain nightly thumbv6m-none-eabi
    # necessary linker
    cargo install flip-link
    # Useful to creating UF2 images for the RP2040 USB Bootloader
    cargo install elf2uf2-rs --locked
    # Useful for flashing over the SWD pins using a supported JTAG probe
    # this contains  cargo-embed too. Also available via homebrew
    cargo install cargo-binstall
    cargo binstall probe-rs-tools
    {% endhighlight %}

An we are ready to go!

#### Hardware Setup

##### Listing available probes

I have various probes I am going to test with. An ST-Link [v2 clone](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-v2.html), an [st-link nucleo](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html), a [segger basic](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/j-link-base/) and a [rusty-probe](https://github.com/probe-rs/rusty-probe)

    {% highlight bash %}
    probe-rs list
    {% endhighlight %}

Listing the three probes is not an issue on `Mac OS 14.5`. I plug the probes, I run `probe-rs` (see documentation at [https://probe.rs/](https://probe.rs/)) list and I see them.

##### RP2040 compatible debuggers

Next I want to run some code on the chips so I clone the [repository](https://github.com/bedroombuilds/pico-usb) and I do `cargo run`. 

    {% highlight bash %}
    git clone https://github.com/maebli/pico-usb // my personal fork
    cd rp2040-blink
    probe-rs run --chip RP2040 target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/debug/rp2040-blink
    {% endhighlight %}

Somehow I have issues. It turns out, that st-link is vendor locked and can only be used to debug and flash st products. I found this out on the porbe-rs matrix channel. Rusty-probe initially does not work but soon it works due to `SWDIO`and `SWCLK` being swapped. Further the segger basic also works, however, I had to connect like I showed in [one of my first posts](https://maebli.github.io/pico/hardware/2021/02/17/raspberry-pi.html). For the rusty-probe I just need `GND`, `SWIO` and `SWCLK` and I can debug. 


##### Debugging with VS Code

To debug within `VS Code` I installed the VS Code extension and created two debug settings (see repos, and also here):

        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "type": "probe-rs-debug",
                "request": "launch",
                "name": "debug-rp2040-rtic-usb-serial-blinky",
                "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
                "connectUnderReset": false,
                "chip": "RP2040",
                "flashingConfig": {
                    "flashingEnabled": true,
                    "haltAfterReset": true
                },
                "coreConfigs": [
                    {
                        "coreIndex": 0,
                        "programBinary": "rp2040-rtic-usb-serial-blinky/target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/debug/rp2040-rtic-usb-serial-blinky"
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                "type": "probe-rs-debug",
                "request": "launch",
                "name": "debug-rp2040-blink",
                "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
                "connectUnderReset": false,
                "chip": "RP2040",
                "flashingConfig": {
                    "flashingEnabled": true,
                    "haltAfterReset": true
                },
                "coreConfigs": [
                    {
                        "coreIndex": 0,
                        "programBinary": "rp2040-blink/target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/debug/rp2040-blink"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    {% endhighlight %}

With these I was able to debug. Debugging the host code was the same as debugging any other existing program. I found the com port created by Pi used in the host application by listing the devices 
available and then diffing when plugging the RP2040 in and out. 


#### Software Setup

There are two repos that are mentioned in the workshop. One is [https://github.com/mike-kfed/embedded_drivers](https://github.com/mike-kfed/embedded_drivers) and the other is the already mentioned [https://github.com/bedroombuilds/pico-usb](https://github.com/bedroombuilds/pico-usb)

##### Developing for embedded targets in rust

###### General 

Here are some important things to know about rust embedded development.

- Rust 1.0 came out in 2015, embedded_hal 1.0 only recently. 
- embedded development is done with `no_std` , meaning things like Smart pointers and Display traits are not included i.e. "batteries not included". The box type is also not included but may be added with ``core::alloc`
- `PAC/HAL/BSP`: often contain unsafe code
    - `BSP`: implements hardware layer
    - `HAL`: "only" traits, this way it works on all uP, mostly works, has improved a lot. Interrupts are still hard to abstract, injecting an interrupt into code is hard
    - `PAC`: is specific to a micro controller and generated directly from the micro controller's description (usually in SVD or similar format). A PAC provides low-level register access that is faithful to the micro controller's specification, allowing developers direct interaction with the hardware through Rust's type system, which ensures memory safety and concurrency.
- Targets have varying level of support. Best supported are ARM / RISC. There is a platform support page that puts support in different categories. [Tier-1 are the best.]https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html#tier-1-with-host-tools)


- read embedded-hal docs 
    - [section for driver authors](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/latest/embedded_hal/spi/index.html#for-driver-authors)
    - search [crates.io](crate.io) using "embedded-hal"
    - search for projects on github with "embedded-hal" referenced

###### Setup Clippy  / Lint to be more strict can help

`.clippy.toml for settings of clippy following settings can be helpful
   
    {% highlight toml %}
    allow-unwrap-in-tests = true
    allow-unexpect-in-tests = true
    {% endhighlight %}

some additional helpful lints are:

    {% highlight toml %}
    [lints.clippy]
    unwrap_used = "deny"
    unwrap_in_result = "deny"
    panic = "deny"
    expect_used = "deny"
    unimplemented = "deny"
    suspicious = {level = "deny", priority = -1}
    style = { level = "deny", priority = -1}
    complexity = { level = "deny", priority = -1}
    perf = { level = "deny", priority = -1}
    {% endhighlight %}


###### Typestate pattern

With this, method / pattern can be bound to states. It is checked at compile time that state allows function / transition.  The example that was given was the following:

    {% highlight rust %}
    struct Mario;
    struct SuperMario;

    impl Mario {
        fn die(self) { drop(self) ; }
        fn grow(self) -> SuperMario {
            SuperMario::from(self)
        }
    }


    impl SuperMario {
        fn shrink(self) -> Mario {
            Mario::from(self)
        }
    }
    {% endhighlight %}

With this method, super mario cannot die. It is clear at compile time. 

Note: Methods should also be testable with another method


###### Traits

trait bounds (refresher):

(a) with "where" for a lot of trait bounds
(b) with "dyn" for few e.g. "delay: &mut dyn DelaysMs<u16>"


see also rust by example

- Rust has no inheritance, only traits
- important for embedded Hal, if we want to implement an i2c, we implement a trait for it
- default traits can be overridden
- critical section used for adding for example stuff that the HAL does not support like two CS for SPI

*challenge*: write drivers that are platform-agnostic. 


Usually trait bounds are defined for the implementation not for the struct, even though it is possible. 

Associated type for traits

    {% highlight rust %}
        trait Animal {
            Error = i32; ////<-- associated type
            fn eat
        }
    {% endhighlight %}

###### some embedded files in a crate that are not normally found in a rust workspace

- build.rs <- script to read the linker file
- memory.x  <- linker file
- .cargo, this is where the `probe-rs run --chip`is hidden! makes thing magically run with cargo run
