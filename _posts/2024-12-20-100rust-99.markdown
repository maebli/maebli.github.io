## What is this :grey_question: 

The rules of the game are explained [in my original](https://maebli.github.io/rust/2021/10/18/100rust.html). 


## 99th Challenge
### Challenge

Today's challenge is day 23 of advent of code 2024.

### Solution

Today's challenge was graph theory related[day 23 of advent of code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/23). 
I looked for a crate that could help and found [graphrs crate](https://docs.rs/graphrs/latest/graphrs/index.html). 
The crate counts traingles. So I counted traingles with and without 't' **at the beginning of the name** (first I just checked any where in the name) and then subtracted the two. 
Note, because each node counts traingles for its self and the other nodes, I had to divide by 3. 

For the second part I'm not exactly sure what I did yet. I didn't find functions that count maximum cliques so I looked ath other functions in graphrs. 
I found the function `generalized_degree` and I found a condition for its output that matches maximum clique size of the graph. 
I'm not sure why though, and I'm not sure if it works on other inputs as well.



```rust
use graphrs::{algorithms::cluster, Edge, Graph, GraphSpecs};

fn main() {
    let input = include_str!("input.txt");

    let mut graph_with_t: Graph<&str, ()> = Graph::new(GraphSpecs::undirected_create_missing());
    let mut graph_without_t: Graph<&str, ()> = Graph::new(GraphSpecs::undirected_create_missing());

    input.lines().for_each(|line| {
        let mut parts = line.split("-");
        let n1 = parts.next().unwrap();
        let n2 = parts.next().unwrap();

        let edge = Edge::new(n1, n2);
        graph_with_t.add_edge(edge.clone()).unwrap();

        if !n1.starts_with("t") && !n2.starts_with("t") {
            graph_without_t.add_edge(edge).unwrap();
        }
    });

    let triangles_with_t = cluster::triangles(&graph_with_t, None);
    let triangles_without_t = cluster::triangles(&graph_without_t, None);

    if let (Ok(with_t), Ok(without_t)) = (triangles_with_t, triangles_without_t) {
        println!(
            "result part1: {:?}",
            with_t.values().sum::<usize>() / 3 - without_t.values().sum::<usize>() / 3
        );
    }

    let g = graph_with_t;

    let c = cluster::generalized_degree(&g, None);

    let mut pass = vec![];
    if let Ok(clustering) = c {
        let max = clustering
            .iter()
            .map(|(_node, cluster_map)| {
                cluster_map
                    .iter()
                    .filter(|(key, value)| **key as i32 - 1 == **value as i32)
                    .map(|(key, _value)| key)
                    .max()
                    .unwrap_or(&0)
            })
            .max()
            .unwrap();

        println!("max: {:?}", max);

        for (node, cluster_map) in clustering.iter() {
            for (key, value) in cluster_map.iter() {
                // key and value are values for clustring hashmap where key is max and value is 1+max
                if key == max && value == &(max + 1) {
                    pass.push(node.clone());
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    pass.sort();
    println!("result part2: {:?}", pass.join(","));
}
