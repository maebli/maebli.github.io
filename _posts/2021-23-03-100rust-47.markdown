## What is this :grey_question: 

The rules of the game are explained [in my original post](https://maebli.github.io/rust/2021/10/18/100rust.html). 

## 48th Challenge
### Challenge

Learn to use neovim to as an alternative IDE as opposed to Intellj. I have been teaching myself VIM and have sen lots of examples of developers using vim to program rust. To test my setup I will use aoc 2015 day one challenge.


### Solution :white_check_mark:

![](/assets/img/vimide.png)

I chose to try this myself with the following setup:
(1) Use Neovim
(2) Use https://vim-bootstrap.com/ for settingn my config file for rust

	{% highlight rust %}
    fn main() {
        let ans1: i32 = INPUT
            .chars()
            .map(|x| match x {
                '(' => 1,
                ')' => -1,
                _ => 0,
            })
            .sum();

        println!("{}", ans1);

        let ans2 = INPUT
            .chars()
            .enumerate()
            .fold((-1i32, 0i32), |mut acc, inst| {
                match inst.1 {
                    '(' => acc.1 = acc.1 as i32 + 1,
                    ')' => acc.1 = acc.1 as i32 - 1,
                    _ => {}
                }
                if acc.1 < 0 && acc.0 == -1 {
                    acc.0 = inst.0 as i32 + 1
                }
                acc
            })
            .0;

        println!("{}", ans2);
    }

    const INPUT:&str=
    "()(((()))(())
    ";
	{% endhighlight %}
