## What is this :grey_question: 

The rules of the game are explained [in my original post](https://maebli.github.io/rust/2021/10/18/100rust.html). 

## 44rd Challenge
### Challenge

Recently I discovered code wars. It has some fun learning challenges. Today the challenge is to solve some of the code war challenges.

### Solution :white_check_mark:

Encode DNA, in hindsight and by look at solutions of others, this would have been easier to solve with `map`

	{% highlight rust %}
	fn dna_strand(dna: &str) -> String {
	    dna.chars().fold(String::new(), |mut acc, inst| {
	        match inst {
	            'T' => acc.push('A'),
	            'A' => acc.push('T'),
	            'G' => acc.push('C'),
	            'C' => acc.push('G'),
	            _x => panic!("wrongly formatted dna sequence"),
	        }
	        acc
	    })
	}
	{% endhighlight %}

Next I solved a challenge to sort a `u64` according to decimal digits.

	{% highlight rust %}
		fn dna_strand(dna: &str) -> String {
	use itertools::Itertools;

	fn descending_order(x: u64) -> u64 {
	    x.to_string()
	    .chars()
	    .sorted()
	    .rev()
	    .collect::<String>()
	    .parse()
	    .unwrap()
	}
	{% endhighlight %}


The challenges were fun and it was very helpful to see solutions of others. I may repeat this in the future.
