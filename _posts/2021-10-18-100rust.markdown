## Why Rust?

Like many before me, I have gained interest in the rust programming language. My main interest comes from the fact that it can be used for embedded programming. There is a lot of activity on the topic, see [Embedded Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/what/embedded) for more information. Before I feel comfortable diving into this world, I want to learn the basics. 


## 100 part challenge

Initially I had written here to do this in 100 days. I have had times on and off of increased and decreased motivation and dedication to this project.
However, in 2024, three years after I started this project, I have decided to finish it. I have 4 challenges left to do.

* 1 unique code snippet per day for 100 days
* Come up with a challenge
* Solve the challenge
* Upload and present
* ???
* Profit


## First challenge


### Challenge

Screen scrape a random recipe name from `chefkoch.de` and display its name on the terminal

From the site [](https://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/was-koche-ich-heute/) random recipes are displayed, so what I must do is

Lets test with bash, what needs to be done to screen scrape the right stuff

	
	
	{% highlight bash %}
	#!/bin/bash
	curl -s https://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/was-koche-ich-heute/|grep -Eo "(http|https)://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/[a-zA-Z0-9./?=_%:-]*" | sort -u|cut -d/ -f6|cut -d. -f1|tr - " "|tail -1
	{% endhighlight %}

Will give us a menu suggestion

	Gefuellte Muschelnudeln

Do this in rust.

### Solution

First we need to download the web page `reqwest` crate seems suitable for this job. Next the document is parsed with `select` and filtered.


	{% highlight rust %}
	use select::document::Document;
	use select::predicate::Name;

	fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
	    /* Fetch the website with GET Request */
	    let body =
	        reqwest::blocking::get("https://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/was-koche-ich-heute/")?.text()?;
	    /* Parse the HTML txt, extract the urls and filter the relevant ones */
	    let yum = Document::from(body.as_str())
	        .select(Name("a"))
	        .filter_map(|n| n.attr("href"))
	        .filter(|x| x.contains("www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/"))
	        .next()
	        .unwrap()
	        .split("/")
	        .last()
	        .unwrap()
	        .replace(".html", "")
	        .replace("-", " ");
	    println!("{}", yum);
	    Ok(())
	}
	{% endhighlight %}


Next question, where can I have live demos of my code? For now I'll upload it to my github page, see [](https://github.com/maebli/100rustsnippets/blob/master/web-scrapper/src/main.rs)
