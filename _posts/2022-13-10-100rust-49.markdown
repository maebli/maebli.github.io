## What is this :grey_question: 

The rules of the game are explained [in my original post](https://maebli.github.io/rust/2021/10/18/100rust.html). 
I haven't posted in a while but I want to get started again. 

## 49th Challenge
### Challenge

Today the challenge will be simple. Use rust bindings to create a hello world. Also, because there is a greate hype around AI generating code and images from text I will use both in this post.


### Solution :white_check_mark:

*Ferris the crab from the rust programming language drawn as gta character.*

We will use code pilot from github to generate the javascript binding. With the promt `/* bind javascript */` the first prompt is as follows

	{% highlight rust %}
    fn main() {
    /* bind javascript */
    let js = include_str!("../js/main.js");
	{% endhighlight %}

This looks good at first glance but will actually jsut print out the text contained in our `main.js`. `main.js` was also generated with a prompt contains the text 

    {% highlight rust %}
    /*Hello world javascript*/
    console.log("Hello world");
    {% endhighlight %}

Sadly that was the only suggestion, so I try with a different approach. Lets try again.. 

    {% highlight rust %}
    /* use js macro cargo */
    use js::js;

    fn main() {
    /* bind javascript helloWorld() from js/main.js to rust as function */
    let hello_world = js! {
        function helloWorld() {
            console.log("Hello World!");
        }
    };

    println!("{}",hello_world);

    }
    {% endhighlight %}

Again it looks promising, but it does not work either, so I give up and do some googling. [Rust by Example](https://rust-by-example-ext.com/webassembly/nodejshelper.html) tells us to use the cargo `nodejs-helper` so lets try to add this to the prompt. Basically the helper just runs the javascript in a nodejs, the repos is found [here](https://github.com/second-state/nodejs-helper).


    {% highlight rust %}
    use nodejs_helper::*;
    use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

    #[wasm_bindgen]
    pub fn hello_world() {
    nodejs_helper::console::log("Timestamp now: ");
    }

    fn main() {
    hello_world()
    }
    {% endhighlight %}

However this is not what I'm trying to achive, this won't run like a rust application. So I looked further and found [wasmedge-quickjs](https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs).



See [github](https://github.com/maebli/100rustsnippets/tree/master/aoc-2015-day1) for today's simple snippet.
